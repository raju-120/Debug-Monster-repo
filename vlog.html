This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer.Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment. Any variables assigned without an explicit scope automatically become global variables.</p>

The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it. Variables declared with the var keyword, do not have block scope.</p>

            How Does the JS Event Loop works?
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            
            <p class="card-text">JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.The following sections explain a theoretical model. Modern JavaScript engines implement and heavily optimize the described semantics.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Stack: Function calls form a stack of frames.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Order of operations: <br>
  
              1. When calling bar, a first frame is created containing references to bar's arguments and local variables. <br>
             2. When bar calls foo, a second frame is created and pushed on top of the first one, containing references to foo's arguments and local variables. <br>
             3.When foo returns, the top frame element is popped out of the stack (leaving only bar's call frame). <br>
             4. When bar returns, the stack is empty.</p> <br>
             <p class="card-text">Heap:
              Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large (mostly unstructured) region of memory.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Queue: 
                A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, which is a list of messages to be processed. Each message has an associated function that gets called to handle the message. <br>
                
                At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue, starting with the oldest one. To do so, the message is removed from the queue and its corresponding function is called with the message as an input parameter. As always, calling a function creates a new stack frame for that function's use.
                 <br>
                The processing of functions continues until the stack is once again empty. Then, the event loop will process the next message in the queue (if there is one).</p>
